Description: Tools to process ground-truth data on crop types and perform a phenology based crop type classification. These tools were developed in the scope of the CAWa project and extend on the work of Conrad et al. (2011) <doi:10.1080/01431161.2010.550647>. Moreover, they introduce an innovative classification and validation scheme that utilizes spatially independent samples as proposed by Remelgado et al. (2017) <doi:10.1002/rse2.70>.
